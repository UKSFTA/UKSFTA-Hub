(Author ABU MIRAJ / mental state: compromised)

People keep pretending they matter.
That’s the funny part.

The family was still warm when we found them. Too many heartbeats in one place. It felt crowded. I don’t like crowded things. They cry as if noise is currency, as if volume buys mercy. It doesn’t. It just makes the ending sharper.

I learned something there.
Pain makes people honest. Terror makes them simple. You can peel them down to exactly what they are with enough time and the right tools. I enjoyed that. Not the act — the reaction. The way they finally understood how little they were worth.

I didn’t feel anything afterward. That was even better.

Sanda Island feels lighter now. Like it exhaled. Like it was waiting for someone to do what needed doing. Blood dries fast near the water. Convenient.

THE MASON is here.
I can tell because things are finally being put where they belong. Safehouses growing in the dark like tumors. Networks tightening. Order emerging from the mess of people pretending to be important.

He understands.
Not people — structures. Humans are just materials.

I think he’s pleased. I hope so. I want to be useful again. I want more chances to practice. Torture is just conversation without lies. Killing is punctuation.

If they send us back, I won’t hesitate.
If they don’t, I’ll find my own work.

People are loud.
The quiet after is beautiful.
