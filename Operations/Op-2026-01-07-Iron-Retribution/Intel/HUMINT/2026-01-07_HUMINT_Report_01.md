**HUMINT REPORT: SOURCE 26-B3-01**

**1. SOURCE DETAILS**

a. **Source ID:** 26-B3-01
b. **Description:** Civilian resident of Sanda Island. Assessed as pro-UKSF but acting out of fear. Not a trained observer.
c. **Access:** Has line-of-sight to a coastal area frequented by ABU MIRAJ.
d. **Reliability/Credibility:** Source Reliability: C (Fairly Reliable). Information Credibility: 4 (Doubtful - based on fear and second-hand accounts).

**2. SUMMARY OF INFORMATION**

a. Source reports that ABU MIRAJ has resumed activities at a coastal location on Sanda Island. This follows a previous incident at the same location where an explosion killed MIRAJ's assistant and nearly killed him.
b. Source describes MIRAJ's demeanor as unnervingly calm and detached. The source reports hearing that MIRAJ laughed after surviving the initial explosion, an observation that has led the source to believe MIRAJ is psychologically unstable and "incapable of fear".
c. The source confirms that an entity known as THE MASON is understood to be in control of Sanda Island.
d. The source expresses extreme fear of MIRAJ and what he is building.

**3. DETAILED REPORT (SOURCE'S OWN WORDS - TRANSLATED/EDITED FOR CLARITY)**

"ABU MIRAJ is by the water again. It's the same place the last one went wrong. There was a blast, I felt it from my home. Later, we saw the blood and shrapnel. His assistant died. MIRAJ survived. I was told he crawled from the wreckage laughing. He learned something from it.

Now he is back there, working more slowly and carefully. He seems to be smiling at the components. I have stayed hidden from him; his laugh is not something I want to hear myself.

The word is that THE MASON is in control of Sanda now and has brought order. I hope this order is enough to stop MIRAJ before he finishes whatever he is building. If it goes wrong again, he will laugh. If it goes right, many others will not. I am afraid, and I don't think he is."

**4. ANALYST'S ASSESSMENT**

a. This report provides further evidence of ABU MIRAJ's role as a weapons technician for the network. The description of his behavior is consistent with a psychological profile of a highly dangerous, goal-oriented individual with a disregard for human life.
b. The previous explosion was likely an accidental detonation during device construction. MIRAJ's survival and continued work indicate resilience and a learning process. The device he is building now is likely more refined and potentially more stable.
c. The mention of THE MASON's control of Sanda Island by a civilian source corroborates SIGINT and other intelligence streams. It indicates his authority is widely known on the island.
d. **Recommendation:** ABU MIRAJ should be considered a high-priority target for capture and technical exploitation, as he likely possesses unique knowledge of the network's weapon capabilities. The source (26-B3-01) should be handled with extreme care due to their high state of fear.
