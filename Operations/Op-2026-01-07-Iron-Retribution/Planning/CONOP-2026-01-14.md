## 1. Situation
a. General
The security environment on the Korean Peninsula has deteriorated due to intelligence indicating
undeclared DPRK strategic weapons activity and the detention of a Western technical advisor under
unknown circumstances. The DPRK operates a closed, highly militarised internal security model with
layered counter-intelligence, dense air defence, and rapid reaction forces.

NATO will not overtly engage. The United Kingdom has been authorised to conduct deniable unilateral
special operations in support of broader NATO deterrence objectives.

b. Enemy Forces
(1) Disposition - Korean People's Army (KPA) maintains nationwide territorial control - Strategic Rocket
Force operates concealed underground facilities - Reconnaissance General Bureau (RGB) conducts
counter-intelligence - Dense integrated air defence systems (IADS)

(2) Capabilities - Rapid internal troop redeployment
infrastructure - Civilian surveillance and informant networks

Extensive hardened and subterranean

(3) Limitations - Rigid command hierarchy - Limited decentralised ISR fusion - Reliance on fixed
infrastructure

c. Friendly Forces
(1) Higher HQ Mission
UK Strategic Command conducts covert operations in support of NATO deterrence and strategic
intelligence objectives without escalation.

(2) Adjacent Units
NATO and allied forces will not cross DPRK borders. No conventional forces available for
reinforcement.

(3) Supporting Units
UKSF Task Force Alpha - SAS (Sabre): Direct Action, Sensitive Site Exploitation - SBS (Trident): Maritime
insertion/exfiltration, coastal ISR - SRR (Raven): Long-term ISR, human terrain mapping - UKSF Aviation
Detachment: Low-observable insertion/extraction (off-map)

United States Support (Contingency / Deniable) - Emergency aviation and limited strike support
available if mission-critical - Support deployed from US-controlled airbases outside the AO - Rotary-wing
support provided by US SOF aviation units - Aircraft may include MH-47G, MH-60M, and AH-6 variants.

US forces remain under national command and will operate in support of UKSF objectives only if
authorised.

d. Civil Considerations
* Civilian population under strict state control
* High likelihood of civilian presence near military facilities
* Civilian casualties risk strategic escalation

## 2. Mission
> UKSF Task Force Alpha conducts covert operations within DPRK territory to locate, verify, and exploit
> undeclared strategic missile infrastructure; determine the status of a detained Western technical
> advisor; and conduct limited disruption to degrade DPRK strategic capability without attribution in
> order to support NATO deterrence objectives.

## 3. Execution
### Commander’s Intent
Purpose: Generate strategic intelligence and leverage without escalation.
Method: Covert infiltration, intelligence-led targeting, minimal force, deniable actions.
End State: Strategic DPRK capabilities mapped - Western asset status resolved - UK and allied
involvement remains deniable.

### Scheme of Manoeuvre (SoM)
- **PHASE 1 - INFILTRATION** - Maritime insertion via contested littoral zones OR - HALO/HAHO airborne
insertion from international airspace - Establish hide sites, comms relays, and emergency caches.
- **PHASE 2 - INTELLIGENCE COLLECTION** - Confirm location and function of underground facilities -
Conduct pattern-of-life analysis - Technical exploitation of power, comms, and logistics nodes.
- **PHASE 3 - LIMITED DIRECT ACTION** - Sensitive Site Exploitation (SSE) - Disruption of critical nodes to
appear accidental - Detention or confirmation of Western asset if mission-critical.
- **PHASE 4 - EXFILTRATION** - Maritime or airborne extraction at designated windows - Activation of
evasion routes if compromised - Zero recoverable equipment left in AO.

### Tasks to Subordinate Units
- **SAS (Sabre)** - Conduct Direct Action and SSE - Execute time-sensitive targeting if authorised
- **SBS (Trident)** - Conduct maritime insertion/exfiltration - Coastal ISR and extraction corridor security
- **SRR (Raven)** - Long-term ISR and surveillance - Human terrain and pattern-of-life analysis
- **US SOF Aviation (If Authorised)** - Emergency extraction and personnel recovery - Limited armed
overwatch for exfiltration only - No routine CAS or persistent air presence

## 4. Coordination Instructions
- **Mission abort criteria strictly enforced**
- **No identifiable UK or coalition markings**
- **Capture risk assessed as EXTREME**
- **Air support requires Task Group Commander approval**

---

## 5. Service Support (CSS)
a. Logistics
* No routine resupply inside AO
* All equipment non-attributable
* Emergency extraction by allied aviation may be authorised

b. Medical
* Organic medical support only
* CASEVAC by allied aviation authorised only if extraction criteria met
* No fixed-wing MEDEVAC inside AO

---

## 6. Command & Signal
a. Command
* OPCON: UK Strategic Command
* TACON: UKSF Task Force Alpha
* US SOF aviation remains under US national command

b. Signal
* Primary: Burst satellite communications
* Alternate: One-way data transfer methods
* Emergency: Pre-arranged environmental or brevity signals

---

## 7. Risk Assessment
* Operational Risk: VERY HIGH
* Political Risk: EXTREME
* Escalation Risk: Managed through deniability
