# [RESTRICTED] TRAINING DASHBOARD GUIDE

This guide defines the protocols for utilizing the Training Dashboard and associated personnel files for candidate tracking.

---

## OPERATIONAL USAGE

1.  **Candidate Induction:**
    *   Initialize a new personnel file using the `Personnel-Template.md`.
    *   Deploy the file into the `Personnel/Roster/` directory.
    *   Set the `status` metadata to `Basic Training` or `Continuation`.
    *   Assign the appropriate `phase` (e.g., `Selection`, `Phase 2`).

2.  **Progression Updates:**
    *   Updates to the `status` or `phase` fields in the metadata will automatically synchronize with the unit-specific dashboards.
    *   Training is conducted in **2-hour modular blocks**. Ensure all session notes are recorded in the candidate's dossier.
