Initial Candidate Evaluation (ICE) - Phase 1 Doctrinal Review

This document outlines the theoretical assessment for candidates seeking attachment to this section. The objective is to verify a candidate's grasp of Special Reconnaissancenaissance (SR) doctrine, technical proficiency, and mission-first decision-making under stress.

Candidates are required to provide detailed, logic-based responses to the following operational scenarios:

---
### SECTION 1: CLOSE TARGET RECONNAISSANCE (CTR)

1. You are within 50m of a target with active thermal patrols. What specific light and noise discipline measures are you taking to prevent detection?

1A. Full silent using hand signals to communicate, all lights off, and try to get into defilade and possibly into any foliage to mask my thermal signiture behind terrain and brush

2. You have "eyes-on" a target for a 10-minute window. What are the three most critical Priority Intelligence Requirements (PIR) you will identify before breaking contact?

2A. Unsure if target means objective target, or singular man target so I'll give two answers for both of my interpretations, when viewing a target objective I'd count amount of visible hostiles at the objective, where their main fortifications like machine gun emplacements are, and finally any avenues for escape for the hostiles therefore I can possible point them out to my team to make sure no hostiles are able to escape the assault that may or may not occur, If we're talking about a singular man target I'd check for clothing to hopefully distinguish him from possible guards or other hositles, facial features like beards or anything that is defining on his character, and finally avenues of escape he might try take if we do try to snatch him.

3. A hostile sentry begins moving directly toward your stationary position during a CTR. Do you engage with your suppressed weapon, or do you attempt a "freeze-and-fade"? What factors dictate that choice?

3A. My first instinct is to drop them but that depends on a couple factors, like how many times they're calling in on radio for sitreps to the main garrison, if they're calling in every 2-4 minutes we have max 4 minutes till the hostiles realise something is up, another point is how many there are in the sentry, if its too many to drop all at once one could call in over their radio about us again alerting hostiles, I am not sure what is meant by a "freeze-and-fade" but if it's anything like I'm thinking about it where we'd get into hidden positions and hide away till the sentry is done with our location, it seems like the best option out the two.

### SECTION 2: COUNTER-SNIPER & OBSERVATION

4. Your team is receiving precision fire from an unknown suppressed platform. How do you utilize your spotting scope to locate the shooter without exposing your position to lens glint?

4A. My first thought is to get into somewhere shaded so the sun can't glint into the lens, I don't know if this is the correct course of action but it's the only one I can think of, but once I've got my scope in a shaded location I'd try to get a range of bearing from where the team is getting hit from, hopefully they'd be able to get hints from bullets hitting walls from a certain location I'd then mark out a range on my map and then scan through buildings, and hill tops in that range to hopefully find and dust being kicked up from the hostile sharpshooter.

5. You’ve successfully spotted the threat. Give me a clear, concise contact report for your shooter using the direction-distance-reference-target format.

5A. bearing 275, distance 1140 meters, 3rd floor of the house on the hillside, 1x hostile sniper with suppressed M107.

6. If your shooter misses the first shot and the target moves to cover, what is your immediate follow-up action as a spotter to ensure the second shot connects?

6A. Give my shooter adjustments like high right, low left, update him on range if the contact moved back or forward at all and open up my range card and try to get exact mils for the shot.

### SECTION 3: COMMS FAILURE & ISOLATION

7. You are separated from the patrol at night and both your primary and secondary radios are dead. Do you attempt to track the patrol's last known movement, or do you move to the Emergency Rendezvous (ERV)?

7A. I would go to the emergency rendezvous

8. You’ve reached the ERV but the team isn't there. You are carrying a rugged tablet with mission-critical intelligence. What is your priority: waiting for the team or moving to the extraction point alone?

8A. I'd head to the extraction point, I'm carrying mission-critical intelligence, if they haven't came to the ERV then there's the possibilty they're dead or captured which I wouldn't be able to fix all by myself, the only thing I can insure is that the intel gets back to base

9. How would you use an IR strobe or signaling mirror to alert a friendly overwatch team of your location without alerting hostiles in the immediate vicinity?

9A. I do not know anything about IR/signaling, I'll have to get taught that.

### SECTION 4: TECHNICAL PROFICIENCY

10. In a high-stress engagement, why would you choose to "dial for elevation" on your scope rather than "holding over," and who makes that call—the shooter or the spotter?

10A. Allows for much quicker shots and reaqusiiton on target than having to remember what mils you were on in your scope, spotter I believe should make the call as they're the higher experienced shooter in most if not all cases.

11. What steps do you take to manage the electronic signature of your rugged tablet and cellphone to prevent enemy Electronic Warfare units from triangulating your position?

11A. I don't know the mechanics of electronic signatures within Arma 3, I'll have to get taught it. But if I'd have to guess, phone would have to be fully off and rugged tablet the same and should only be turned on when absolutely needed
