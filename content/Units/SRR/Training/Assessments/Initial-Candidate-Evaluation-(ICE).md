**UNIT:** Special Reconnaissance Regiment (SRR)
**MODULE:** Phase 1 - Doctrinal & Technical Review
**VERSION:** 2026.1

-

### **INSTRUCTIONS TO CANDIDATE**
*Answer all questions with maximum detail. Where applicable, reference specific technical procedures for **ACE3**, **ACRE2**, and **cTAB**. Your responses will be evaluated on doctrinal accuracy, tactical logic, and technical proficiency.*

-

### **SECTION 1: CLOSE TARGET RECONNAISSANCE (CTR)**

**1.1 [ENVIRONMENTAL DISCIPLINE]**
You are established in a static OP within 75m of a target compound. Hostile patrols are equipped with thermal optics. 
*   Describe your cam-up procedure.
*   What ACE3 interaction measures are taken to minimize your thermal and noise signature?
*   How do you manage your team's silhouette against the skyline?

**1.2 [INTELLIGENCE PRIORITIZATION]**
You have "eyes-on" a high-value meeting for a 5-minute window. 
*   Identify the three most critical **Priority Intelligence Requirements (PIR)** you must satisfy before the window closes.
*   How do you document these using the **cTAB Rugged Tablet** without being compromised by screen glare?

**1.3 [COMPROMISE DISCIPLINE]**
A hostile sentry stops 10m from your position and appears to be looking directly at your bush. 
*   Define the "Freeze-and-Fade" protocol.
*   At what point do you escalate to using your suppressed primary weapon?
*   What is the immediate ACRE signal to your overwatch team?

-

### **SECTION 2: TECHNICAL SURVEILLANCE & COMMS**

**2.1 [ELECTRONIC SIGNATURE MANAGEMENT]**
Enemy EW (Electronic Warfare) assets are active in the AO. 
*   How do you configure your **ACRE2** radio (power/frequency) to minimize the risk of triangulation?
*   When using the **cTAB BFT**, what setting ensures your position is not being broadcasted to the wider network while still allowing you to receive updates?

**2.2 [REPORTING & B-D-R-T]**
Provide a clear, concise Contact Report for a technical vehicle arriving at a gate.
*   **Bearing:** 245
*   **Distance:** 420m
*   **Reference:** "Red-roofed shed"
*   **Target:** Technical with mounted DShK, 3x occupants.
*   *Write the transmission exactly as it would be spoken over the net.*

-

### **SECTION 3: MEDICAL & ISOLATION**

**3.1 [COVERT CASUALTY CARE]**
Your partner is struck by a single round in the lower leg while in the OP. You are still "unseen."
*   Detail the **ACE3 Medical** steps to stabilize the casualty without alerting hostiles only 50m away.
*   What is the priority: Hemorrhage control or relocation? Explain your reasoning.

**3.2 [THE ERV PROTOCOL]**
Communication is lost, and your team is scattered. You reach the **Emergency Rendezvous (ERV)** but find it compromised by a hostile patrol.
*   What is your secondary action?
*   How do you signal your status to HQ using a non-electronic method (e.g., IR strobe, signaling mirror, or VS-17 panel)?

-

### **SECTION 4: MARKSMANSHIP & BALLISTICS (SPOTTER ROLE)**

**4.1 [THE SPOTTER'S CALCULATION]**
As a spotter for an SRR sniper pair, you are ranging a target at 850m with a 5m/s crosswind from the left.
*   Do you advise the shooter to "hold" or "dial"?
*   Calculate the correction (in Mils or MOA) if the shooter is using a .338 Lapua platform.
*   Who has the final authority to authorize the shot—the shooter or the spotter?
