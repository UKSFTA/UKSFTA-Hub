# [RESTRICTED] RSIS FORM 01-ICE-A: INSTRUCTOR ANSWER KEY

**UNIT:** RSIS - Training Wing
**MODULE:** Phase 1 - Intelligence Doctrine
**VERSION:** 2026.1

-

### **GRADING CRITERIA**
*Look for the "Analyst Mindset": connecting the dots rather than just collecting them.*

-

### **SECTION 1: SIGINT**

**1.1 [DIRECTION FINDING]**
*   **Assessment:** If signal fades as you move North, the source is **South**.
*   **Confirmation:** **Triangulation**. Have a second team take a bearing from a different grid square. The intersection of the two bearings is the target location.

**1.2 [TRAFFIC ANALYSIS]**
*   **Breakdown:** Who (Courier/HVT), What (Moving), Where (To "Green-House"), When (5 mins).
*   **Advice:** "Command, intercept indicates HVT moving to [Grid of Green-House] in 5 mikes. Recommend ambush or drone surveillance."

-

### **SECTION 2: HUMINT**

**2.1 [TACTICAL QUESTIONING]**
*   **Approach:** "Direct" but controlled. "We know who you are and what you were doing. Help us, and we can help you." (Using ACE Interaction to 'Search' first).
*   **LOAC:** No torture, no physical abuse, no degrading treatment.

**2.2 [SOURCE PROTECTION]**
*   **The Meet:** Brush pass, dead drop, or a crowded location where a conversation looks natural. Never bring them to the FOB.
*   **Verification:** Cross-reference their info. If they say "IED at Grid X," fly a drone over Grid X to look for disturbed earth.

-

### **SECTION 3: SSE**

**3.1 [PRIORITIZATION]**
*   **Choice:** **Laptop & Phones**.
*   **Why:** Digital media contains networks, contacts, and future plans. Maps are good but static; photos are low value unless recognized.

**3.2 [CHAIN OF CUSTODY]**
*   **Storage:** Anti-static bag (Faraday cage if possible).
*   **Tagging:** Evidence is useless in court (or intelligence analysis) if we don't know WHERE it came from. "Laptop found in Bedroom 1" links the laptop to the person sleeping there.
