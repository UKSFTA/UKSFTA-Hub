# UKSF Training Template Instructions

This folder contains the standardized structure for SAS and SBS training modules. Follow these steps to customize the training for your unit.

-

## 1. Directory Structure
Ensure each unit has the following sub-folders:
- `Curriculum/`: Detailed syllabus and learning objectives.
- `Assessments/`: ICE (Initial Candidate Evaluation) and practical tests.
- `Reference/`: Technical SOPs for ACE, ACRE, and unit-specific gear.
- `Templates/`: Forms for reporting and documentation.

-

## 2. Customizing the ICE (Initial Candidate Evaluation)
The ICE should test theoretical knowledge. Use the following baseline:
- **Section 1: Unit Doctrine.** (e.g., "What are the four pillars of SBS maritime operations?")
- **Section 2: Technical Skills.** (e.g., "How do you set an M112 charge for a frame charge?")
- **Section 3: Tactical Scenarios.** (e.g., "Your patrol is ambushed in a valley. Detail your immediate action drills.")

-

## 3. Technical Standards (Reference)
Link these to the mods used in the unit.
- **ACRE/TFAR:** Power settings, frequency management.
- **ACE Medical:** Bandaging protocols, medication usage.
- **cTAB:** Marking objectives and BFT management.

-

## 4. Graduation Criteria
Clearly define what constitutes a "Pass" in the `Curriculum.md`.
- No more than 2 "Minor" errors in navigation.
- Zero "Major" safety violations (Blue-on-Blue, NDs).
- 80%+ score on the ICE.

-

## 5. Session Structure
All training is delivered in **2-hour modular blocks**. If a module requires more than 2 hours to complete, it should be split into multiple sessions across different weeks.

-
**Note:** Maintain the professional, realistic tone. Avoid emojis and keep formatting consistent across all units.
