**1. OVERALL ASSESSMENT (C2)**

a. **Insider Threat:** Intelligence (Ref B) indicates with high confidence (B2) that details of OP SILENT HERMES, referred to as the "Korea campaign," were leaked to hostile elements. The leak appears to originate from a UK government or military source ("Governments leak before soldiers do"). This suggests OPSEC has been compromised at a strategic level.

b. **Hostile Network:** A network of actors, codenamed "THE MASON" (Status: KIA) and "THE FERRYMAN" (Status: Active), are aware of UKSF activities. They have used this foreknowledge to conduct a diversionary attack in the UK to distract from their primary operations in a region codenamed "LYTHIUM" (Ref B).

c. **Link to DPRK:** The direct link between the MASON/FERRYMAN network and the primary objective of OP SILENT HERMES in the DPRK remains unclear. However, their awareness of the operation presents a significant threat to mission success and force security.

**2. HOSTILE ACTORS**

a. **THE FERRYMAN**
    (1) **Role:** Assessed as an intelligence broker and facilitator. Appears to have access to high-level UK government/military information. Coordinates movement of personnel and assets.
    (2) **Current Status:** Active. Location unknown.
    (3) **Assessment (B2):** THE FERRYMAN is a high-priority counter-intelligence target. His access to operational details represents a critical threat. He is likely a key node in a wider network.

b. **THE MASON**
    (1) **Role:** Assessed as a network leader, responsible for organisation and logistics on "Sanda Island" and in "Lythium".
    (2) **Current Status:** Confirmed KIA.
    (3) **Assessment (A1):** THE MASON's demise will likely cause short-term disruption to his network. A power vacuum is expected, which may present opportunities for intelligence gathering as his subordinates compete for control.

c. **ABU MIRAJ**
    (1) **Role:** Weapons specialist. Described as highly volatile and reckless.
    (2) **Current Status:** Captured. Was located on Sanda Island (unconfirmed).
    (3) **Assessment (C3):** MIRAJ was likely developing a device for THE MASON. His capture may yield technical intelligence on the network's capabilities. His psychological profile suggests he may be an unreliable source but could be manipulated.

**3. ENEMY CAPABILITIES (DPRK - As per REF A)**

a. **Disposition:** KPA controls all territory. Strategic Rocket Forces operate from concealed UGFs (Underground Facilities). RGB provides counter-intelligence screen. Dense IADS in place.
b. **Capabilities:** Rapid internal deployment, extensive hardened infrastructure, civilian informant networks.
c. **Limitations:** Rigid C2 structure, limited decentralised ISR, reliance on fixed infrastructure.

---

**4. INTELLIGENCE GAPS & REQUIREMENTS (KIRs)**

a. **Insider Threat:**
    (1) Identify the source and scope of the leak to THE FERRYMAN.
    (2) Determine the full extent of the MASON/FERRYMAN network's knowledge of UKSF TTPs and personnel.

b. **Post-Mason Network:**
    (1) Identify the successor to THE MASON.
    (2) Assess the current operational status and cohesion of the network in Lythium.
    (3) Determine who has assumed control of Sanda Island.

c. **OP SILENT HERMES Primary Objectives:**
    (1) Precise location and status of undeclared DPRK strategic missile infrastructure.
    (2) Current status, location, and condition of the detained Western technical advisor.

**5. SOURCE AND RELIABILITY**
*This summary is based on SIGINT and HUMINT of varying reliability. Source and information credibility is graded using the Admiralty System (e.g., A1-F6).*
- Ref B (SIGINT): Source reliability B (Usually reliable), Information credibility 2 (Probably true).
- Ref C (HUMINT): Source reliability C (Fairly reliable), Information credibility 3 (Possibly true).
- Ref D (Casefile): Compiled data, reliability varies.
