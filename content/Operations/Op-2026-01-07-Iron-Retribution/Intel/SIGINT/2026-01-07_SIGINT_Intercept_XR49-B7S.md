**SIGINT REPORT: INTERCEPT XR49-B7S**

**1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY**

a. At 0718Z, 07 JAN 26, GCHQ monitoring assets intercepted an encrypted text-based communication between two hostile actors, identified as THE MASON and THE FERRYMAN.
b. The conversation confirms hostile awareness of UKSF training activities and future operations, specifically "Operation Silent Hermes" (referred to as the "Korea campaign").
c. The intercept explicitly suggests a high-level leak from within the UK government or military ("Governments leak before soldiers do").
d. The actors discuss a diversionary attack in the UK intended to shift UKSF focus away from their primary area of operations, codenamed "LYTHIUM".
e. **Assessment:** This intercept is graded as high-confidence intelligence and indicates a critical compromise of operational security for OP SILENT HERMES.

**2. TECHNICAL DETAILS**

a. **Source:** Intercepted via GCHQ asset [REDACTED], targeting known encrypted messaging application [REDACTED].
b. **Encryption:** [REDACTED] protocol. Successfully decrypted.
c. **Attribution:**
    (1) **THE MASON:** Voice and data analysis from previous intercepts give high confidence in attribution. (Status: NOW CONFIRMED KIA).
    (2) **THE FERRYMAN:** Attribution based on contact analysis and linguistic patterns. Medium confidence.

**3. TRANSCRIPT**

- **[07:18] THE MASON:** The Brits were in the middle of urban assault drills today.
- **[07:20] THE FERRYMAN:** I know. That kind of training doesn't happen by accident.
- **[07:22] THE MASON:** Urban assaults. Built-up areas. Breaching work.
- **[07:23] THE FERRYMAN:** Preparation for their Korea campaign. Somebody warned you. Inside.
- **[07:25] THE MASON:** You're saying this came from their own people.
- **[07:26] THE FERRYMAN:** Training schedules aren't public. Governments leak before soldiers do.
- **[07:28] THE MASON:** That kind of access could expose us.
- **[07:29] THE FERRYMAN:** Only if we stay where they expect us.
- **[07:31] THE MASON:** The attack will pull them inward.
- **[07:32] THE FERRYMAN:** Exactly. While they argue at home, leadership moves.
- **[07:34] THE MASON:** LYTHIUM.
- **[07:35] THE FERRYMAN:** LYTHIUM. Home ground. Where pressure means nothing.
- **[07:37] THE MASON:** Routes are still secure.
- **[07:38] THE FERRYMAN:** They will be. Our people are already shifting east.
- **[07:40] THE MASON:** Then today isn't just an attack.
- **[07:41] THE FERRYMAN:** No. It's a test of how blind they are inside their own house.

**4. DETAILED ANALYSIS**

a. **"Korea campaign":** Assessed with high confidence to be OP SILENT HERMES. The context of UKSF training for urban assault aligns with the mission profile.
b. **Insider Threat:** THE FERRYMAN's statement "Governments leak before soldiers do" strongly implies the source is not a serving military member but a civilian official or politician with access to strategic-level operational planning.
c. **"LYTHIUM":** Assessed to be the primary base of operations for the MASON/FERRYMAN network. It is likely a geographic location where they feel secure from UKSF direct action.
d. **Diversionary Attack:** The dialogue confirms a recent or impending attack on UK soil was deliberately planned as a feint to misdirect UK HMG and military resources.

**5. IMPLICATIONS FOR UKSF**

a. **OPSEC:** OP SILENT HERMES has been compromised. The enemy is aware of the operation's existence and general purpose. All planning and TTPs must be reviewed under the assumption of enemy pre-knowledge.
b. **Counter-Intelligence:** THE FERRYMAN represents a critical CI threat. Identifying and neutralizing him and his source is paramount.
c. **Threat Posture:** The MASON/FERRYMAN network has demonstrated the capability and intent to conduct attacks on UK soil and has access to high-level intelligence. They should be considered a Tier 1 threat.
