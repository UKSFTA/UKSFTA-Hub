- **Mission**: UKSF Task Force Alpha to conduct covert operations in DPRK to:
    
    - Locate, verify, and exploit undeclared strategic missile infrastructure.
    - Determine status of a detained Western technical advisor.
    - Conduct limited disruption to degrade DPRK strategic capability without attribution.
    - Support NATO deterrence objectives.
- **Purpose**: Generate strategic intelligence and leverage without escalation.
    
- **Method**: Covert infiltration, intelligence-led targeting, minimal force, deniable actions.
    
- **End State**: DPRK capabilities mapped, Western asset status resolved, UK/allied involvement deniable.
    
- **Key Phases**:
    
    1. **Infiltration**: Maritime or airborne (HALO/HAHO).
    2. **Intelligence Collection**: Confirm facilities, pattern-of-life, technical exploitation.
    3. **Limited Direct Action**: SSE, critical node disruption, asset detention/confirmation.
    4. **Exfiltration**: Maritime or airborne.
- **Key Units**:
    
    - **UKSF Task Force Alpha**:
        - **SAS (Sabre)**: Direct Action, SSE.
        - **SBS (Trident)**: Maritime insertion/exfiltration, coastal ISR.
        - **SRR (Raven)**: Long-term ISR, surveillance.
    - **US SOF Aviation (Contingency)**: Emergency extraction, limited armed overwatch.
- **Risks**: Operational (VERY HIGH), Political (EXTREME), Escalation (Managed through deniability).
    
- **Deniability**: Crucial. No identifiable markings, no public acknowledgement, loss/capture will be denied.
