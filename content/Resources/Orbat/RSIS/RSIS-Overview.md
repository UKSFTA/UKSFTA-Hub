### **RSIS Branch Briefing: Tactical Intelligence & Exploitation (TIE)**

The Royal Secret Intelligence Service (RSIS) is the specialist exploitation arm of the unit. While the **Int Corps** writes the story, RSIS dismantles the enemy network on the ground. You are the "Technical Edge" that tells SF which doors to kick.

**Core Gameplay Pillars**

- **SIGINT (Signals):** Monitoring enemy radio/cell nets. You provide early warnings of enemy QRF, mortar strikes, and "Direction Finding" to locate enemy HQs.
    
- **HUMINT (Human):** You are the only personnel authorised for **Tactical Questioning**. You interrogate detainees and interact with civilians to find hidden IEDs or HVT escape routes.
    
- **SSE (Forensics):** Once a site is cleared, you move in to "Scrub" it. You secure laptops, documents, and "pocket litter." The intel you find directly unlocks future missions.
    

**Where You Operate**

You operate as a **TIE Cell** (6-man detachment), split into two elements:

- **Technical Pair:** Operates from a Mobile Command Vehicle or Listening Post. You manage the "God’s Eye View" via drones and radio intercepts.
    
- **Exploitation Pair:** Embedded behind E-Squadron. You move in immediately after the "All Clear" to handle prisoners and evidence.
    

**The ORBAT**

- **Detachment Lead:** Liaison with Command/Zeus.
    
- **SIGINT/EW Specialists:** Radio monitoring and UAV oversight.
    
- **Exploitation/TQE Operators:** Site forensics and Interrogations.
    
- **All-Source Analyst:** Real-time enemy tracking and "Target Pack" creation.
    

**The Bottom Line:**

RSIS is for players who want high-responsibility, "intel-led" gameplay. You aren't just another rifle; you are the brains of the operation. Without your work, SF is blind.
