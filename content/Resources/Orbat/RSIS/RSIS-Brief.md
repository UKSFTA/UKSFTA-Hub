# [RESTRICTED] RSIS BRANCH BRIEFING: TACTICAL INTELLIGENCE & EXPLOITATION (TIE)

**UNIT:** Royal Secret Intelligence Service (RSIS)
**SUBJECT:** Operational Doctrine and Role of the TIE Cell
**DATE:** 07 FEB 2026

-

## 1. MISSION STATEMENT
The Royal Secret Intelligence Service (RSIS) serves as the specialist exploitation and technical intelligence arm of the Task Force. While the Intelligence Corps manages strategic analysis, RSIS provides the tactical dismantling of enemy networks on the ground.

-

## 2. CORE OPERATIONAL PILLARS

### 2.1 SIGNALS INTELLIGENCE (SIGINT)
Monitoring of enemy radio and cellular networks. RSIS provides early warning of hostile Quick Reaction Forces (QRF), mortar coordinates, and "Direction Finding" (DF) to locate enemy Command Nodes.

### 2.2 HUMAN INTELLIGENCE (HUMINT)
RSIS personnel are the primary authority for Tactical Questioning (TQ). Operators interrogate detainees and engage with the civilian population to identify IED locations, HVT escape routes, and local power structures.

### 2.3 SENSITIVE SITE EXPLOITATION (SSE)
Upon the clearance of an objective by SAS/SBS, RSIS "scrubs" the site. This involves securing digital media, documents, and "pocket litter" to unlock follow-on missions and map enemy networks.

-

## 3. DEPLOYMENT & INTEGRATION

You operate as a **Forward Exploitation Team (FET)** or **Technical Support Element (TSE)**. You are actively deployed in support of kinetic operations.

- **Technical Specialist (TSE):** Acts as the "Voice in the Ear" for the Ground Commander. Manages ISR assets (UAVs) and actively monitors/jams enemy communications.
    
- **Exploitation Operator (FET):** Embedded directly with the SAS/SBS assault force. Moves immediately behind the assault stack to secure intel, exploit digital terminals, and process high-value detainees before the site is compromised.

-

## 4. UNIT COMPOSITION (ORBAT)

- **Detachment Lead:** Strategic liaison with Command/Zeus.
- **SIGINT/EW Specialists:** Spectrum monitoring and ISR oversight.
- **Exploitation/TQE Operators:** Site forensics and Interrogations.
- **All-Source Analyst:** Real-time target tracking and Target Pack synthesis.

-

## 5. SUMMARY
RSIS is intended for personnel seeking high-responsibility, intelligence-led gameplay. You are the technical edge of the Task Force. Without RSIS exploitation, the strike elements are operating in the dark.
