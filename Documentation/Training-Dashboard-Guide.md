# Training Dashboard Guide

This guide explains how to use the Training Dashboard and the associated personnel files to track candidate progression.

## How to Use

1.  **Add New Candidates:**
    *   Navigate to the `UKSF Taskforce Alpha/Templates` folder.
    *   Copy the `Personnel-Template.md` file.
    *   Paste the copied file into the `UKSF Taskforce Alpha/Personnel/Candidates` folder.
    *   Rename the file to the candidate's name (e.g., `Smith_J.md`).
    *   Fill out the metadata and details in the new file. The `status` should initially be set to `Application`.

2.  **Update Progression:**
    *   To move a candidate along the pipeline, simply edit the `status:` field in their markdown file (e.g., `Doe_J.md`).
    *   For example, changing `status: "Application"` to `status: "Basic Training"` will automatically move them on the [[UKSF Taskforce Alpha/Training/Training Dashboard|Training Dashboard]].

## Progression Statuses

The following are the standard statuses to use in the `status:` field of a personnel file:

- `Application`
- `Interview`
- `Basic Training`
- `JSFAW`
- `Continuation`
- `Specialist Training`
- `Active`
