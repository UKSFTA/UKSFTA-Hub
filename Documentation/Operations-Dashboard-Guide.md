# Operations Dashboard Guide

This guide explains how to use the Operations Dashboard and the associated note-taking system for managing operations.

## How to use this system

1.  **Create a new Operation:**
    *   Create a new folder in the `UKSF Taskforce Alpha/Operations` directory. Name it with the operation number and name, for example `Op-2025-002-Another-Op`.
    *   Inside the new folder, create the `Intel`, `Planning`, `Execution`, and `Post-Op` sub-folders.

2.  **Start a new CONOP:**
    *   Go to the `UKSF Taskforce Alpha/Templates` folder and copy the `CONOP-Template.md`.
    *   Paste it in your new operation's `Planning` folder.
    *   Rename the file to `CONOP-[op_num].md`.
    *   Fill out the metadata at the top of the file (the `---` section).
        *   `type`: "CONOP"
        *   `op_name`: "The name of your operation"
        *   `op_num`: "The operation number, e.g., 2025-002"
        *   `status`: "Draft" (change to "Approved" when ready)

3.  **File other documents:**
    *   Use the other templates (`Intel-Brief-Template.md`, `AAR-Template.md`, etc.) and place them in the corresponding folders of your operation. Remember to fill out the metadata.

4.  **View your operations:**
    *   The [[UKSF Taskforce Alpha/Operations/Operation Dashboard|Operations Dashboard]] will automatically update as you create and modify your operation files.
