# [RESTRICTED] RSIS TECHNICAL STANDARDS: SIGINT, HUMINT, SSE

This document defines the tradecraft standards and technical protocols for the Royal Secret Intelligence Service (RSIS).

---

## 1. SIGNALS INTELLIGENCE (SIGINT)

**"If they speak, we hear."**

### **Procedures:**
- **The Scan:** Continuous monitoring of the 30-80MHz (VHF) spectrum using ACRE racks.
- **The Log:** All intercepts are logged immediately.
    - Format: *Time (Z) - Frequency - Speaker - Message - Assessment*
- **Direction Finding (DF):**
    - **Single Point:** Using signal strength to estimate distance ("Hot/Cold").
    - **Multi Point:** Coordinating with a second TIE element to triangulate an exact grid reference.

## 2. HUMAN INTELLIGENCE (HUMINT)

**"Every contact leaves a trace."**

### **Tactical Questioning (TQ):**
- **The 5 W's:** Who, What, Where, When, Why.
- **The "Shock" Period:** The first 60 seconds after capture are statistically the most productive.
- **Safety:** Never question a detainee alone. The "Coverman" maintains security; the "Questioner" conducts the engagement.

### **Source Handling:**
- **Sanitization:** Never use real names over the net. Assign a pseudonym (e.g., "Source VIKING").
- **Verification:** Corroborate all intelligence with a second discipline (SIGINT or IMINT) before operational action.

## 3. SENSITIVE SITE EXPLOITATION (SSE)

**"The devil is in the details."**

### **The Priority Triangle:**
1.  **Digital Media:** Laptops, Phones, Hard Drives (Strategic value).
2.  **Pocket Litter:** ID cards, receipts, documents (Tactical value).
3.  **Technical Data:** Serial numbers, equipment markings (Logistical tracking).

### **Handling Evidence:**
- **Bag & Tag:** Secure items using designated evidence bags.
- **EM Isolation:** Do not power up captured devices on-target to prevent remote data destruction.

## 4. TECHNICAL SURVEILLANCE & DIRECT SUPPORT

**"The Voice in the Ear."**

- **Priority Interjection:** RSIS operators have "Priority Net" authority for time-critical threat warnings (e.g., "QRF inbound North, 2 mikes").
- **Dynamic Marking:** Utilize cTAB/BFT for real-time marking of HVTs or IEDs. Immediate tactical data takes priority over formal reporting.
- **UAV Overwatch:** Direct integration with the assault team. Provide micro-level situational awareness: "Patrol Lead, two hostiles in the courtyard, suggest flank right."
