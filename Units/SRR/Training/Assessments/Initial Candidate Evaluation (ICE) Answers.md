# [RESTRICTED] SRR FORM 01-ICE-A: INSTRUCTOR ANSWER KEY

**UNIT:** Special Reconnaissance Regiment (SRR)
**MODULE:** Phase 1 - Doctrinal & Technical Review
**VERSION:** 2026.1

---

### **GRADING CRITERIA**
*A "High-Tier" candidate does not just answer the question; they demonstrate an understanding of the second and third-order effects of their actions. Look for mentions of specific mod mechanics (ACE, ACRE, cTAB).*

---

### **SECTION 1: CLOSE TARGET RECONNAISSANCE (CTR)**

**1.1 [ENVIRONMENTAL DISCIPLINE]**
*   **Cam-up:** Multi-terrain pattern (MTP) with 3D scrim. Face paint must break up the "T-zone" of the face.
*   **ACE3/Thermal:** Use of a thermal-reflective poncho (if available) or staying deep in shadows/dense foliage. Minimizing movement to "zero" when patrols are scanning.
*   **Silhouette:** Staying off the "skyline" (military cresting). Using micro-terrain to remain below the horizon line of an observer.

**1.2 [INTELLIGENCE PRIORITIZATION]**
*   **PIRs:** 1. Composition/Identity of HVTs. 2. Specific location of sensitive materials/comms. 3. Vehicle/Exfil data.
*   **cTAB/Glare:** Use of the "Night" or "Red" map mode. Keeping the device inside a smock or under a poncho while in use. Screen brightness at <10%.

**1.3 [COMPROMISE DISCIPLINE]**
*   **Freeze-and-Fade:** Remaining 100% static until the threat moves away. If spotted, slowly backing away into denser cover without turning the back (maintaining eyes-on).
*   **Escalation:** Only when physical contact is imminent or the sentry begins to raise an alarm.
*   **ACRE Signal:** A pre-briefed "click" code (e.g., three rapid PTT presses) or a specific brevity word (e.g., "BROKEN GLASS").

### **SECTION 2: TECHNICAL SURVEILLANCE & COMMS**

**2.1 [ELECTRONIC SIGNATURE MANAGEMENT]**
*   **ACRE2:** Set radio to "Low Power" (100mW/1W). Use of a "Directional Antenna" if applicable. Burst transmissions only.
*   **cTAB BFT:** Disabling "BFT Transmit" while keeping "BFT Receive" active. This allows the operator to see friendlies without broadcasting their own GPS location.

**2.2 [REPORTING & B-D-R-T]**
*   *Model Transmission:* "Overwatch, this is Recce 1. Contact Report. Bearing 245, Distance 420. Reference red-roofed shed. Target 1x Technical with DShK, 3x hostiles stationary at gate. Break. PIR 4 satisfied. How copy?"

### **SECTION 3: MEDICAL & ISOLATION**

**3.1 [COVERT CASUALTY CARE]**
*   **ACE3 Steps:** 1. Immediate Tourniquet (CAT) on the limb. 2. Packing the wound with combat gauze. 3. Elastic bandage. 4. Pain management (Morphine/Fentanyl) only if it doesn't compromise consciousness.
*   **Priority:** **Relocation** (The "Cold Zone"). A casualty in an active OP compromises the entire team. Hemorrhage control must be done "on the move" or in the first available micro-cover.

**3.2 [THE ERV PROTOCOL]**
*   **Secondary Action:** Move to the "Secondary ERV" or "Extraction Point" (P-A-C-E plan).
*   **Non-Electronic Signal:** "Tunnelling" an IR strobe (shielding it so it's only visible from a specific azimuth) or using a signaling mirror toward a known friendly overwatch.

---

### **SECTION 4: MARKSMANSHIP & BALLISTICS (SPOTTER ROLE)**

**4.1 [THE SPOTTER'S CALCULATION]**
*   **Hold vs Dial:** **Dial** for elevation (precision); **Hold** for wind (dynamic).
*   **Correction:** (Depends on specific mod ballistics, but the logic is key). Left 5m/s wind requires a "Right" hold.
*   **Authority:** The **Spotter** (in an SRR pair, the spotter is often the more senior/experienced operator and controls the engagement).
