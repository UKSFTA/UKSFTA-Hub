To compress a 24-hour assessment into a **Modular 4-Hour Evaluation** (split into two 2-hour sessions), we need to focus on "High-Intensity Windows." Instead of long transits, we drop the candidate directly into the "work" phase.

Here is the revised directive.

---

### **SESSION 1: INFILTRATION & INTELLIGENCE (2 HOURS)**

**MODULE A: THE STALKING PHASE (60 MINS)**

- **Objective:** Infiltrate from the Drop Zone (DZ) to a designated Observation Post (OP) position.
    
- **Parameters:** Candidate must traverse 400m of high-threat terrain. OPFOR is actively patrolling with NVG/Thermal assets.
    
- **Evaluation:** Stealth, use of micro-terrain, and thermal signature management.
    
- **Critical Fail:** Visual compromise or "Noise Negligence" (disturbing local wildlife/foliage).
    

**MODULE B: DATA ACQUISITION / ISR (60 MINS)**

- **Objective:** Establish a concealed OP and identify 5 specific Priority Intelligence Requirements (PIR).
    
- **Parameters:** A 45-minute observation window where OPFOR will conduct specific activities (vehicle transfers, guard rotations).
    
- **Evaluation:** Accuracy of the Written Intelligence Report. Reports must include B-D-R-T (Bearing-Distance-Reference-Target) data for all hostiles.
    
- **Critical Fail:** Missing 2 or more primary PIRs or "Lens Glint" detection.

### **SESSION 2: OVERWATCH & EXFILTRATION (2 HOURS)**

**MODULE C: PRECISION SPOTTER (60 MINS)**

- **Objective:** Provide fire-control data for a Designated Marksman during a simulated kinetic window.
    
- **Parameters:** Candidate must range 3 targets and provide windage corrections for a "Cold Bore" shot and two rapid follow-ups.
    
- **Evaluation:** Verbal clarity, ranging accuracy, and correction speed.
    
- **Critical Fail:** Failure to provide a follow-up correction within 3 seconds of a missed "splash."
    

**MODULE D: TACTICAL BREAK-CONTACT (60 MINS)**

- **Objective:** Immediate exfiltration following an OP compromise.
    
- **Parameters:** Candidate must navigate 1.5km to the Emergency Rendezvous (ERV) while being actively pursued by a two-man tracker team.
    
- **Evaluation:** Speed vs. Stealth balance and successful link-up at the ERV within the 3-minute extraction window.
    
- **Critical Fail:** Capture by tracker team or failure to adhere to the PACE plan navigation route.

### **SAFETY & CONDUCT**

1. **WEAPONS:** All platforms remain "Safe/Cold" until the Module C live-fire window.
    
2. **SIGNALING:** Candidates are issued one IR Strobe for Module D. Misuse of the strobe outside the ERV window results in an immediate fail.
    
3. **EQUIPMENT:** Full specialist loadout is required for both sessions. No "slick" runs.

### **Section Leader's Coaching Note:**

By cutting the "dead time" (the long periods of waiting in an OP), you are forcing the candidate to perform the most difficult parts of the job back-to-back. If they can maintain their composure through Module B and go straight into the high-stress spotting of Module C, they have the mental stamina we need.
