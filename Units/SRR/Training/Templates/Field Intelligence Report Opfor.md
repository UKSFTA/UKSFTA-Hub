#### **3. INSTRUCTOR NOTES**

- **VISIBILITY:** Do not hide inside buildings for the entire window. If the candidate can't see you, they can't report on you. Ensure the "Transfer" at T+30:00 happens in an open courtyard or road.
    
- **THERMAL DISCIPLINE:** OPFOR should intentionally use a flashlight or smoke a cigarette once during the night phase to see if the candidate notices the thermal/light bloom.
    
- **REACTION:** If you spot the candidate (glint, movement, or sound), **do not** immediately kill them. Instead, alert other guards, point in their direction, and begin a "suspicious search." This forces the candidate to execute "Freeze-and-Fade."
