### **PIR BRIEFING: OP [INSERT NAME]**

**DATE:** 07 February 2026

**CLASSIFICATION:** RESTRICTED / NATO CONFIDENTIAL

**PREPARED BY:** SSgt. M. Barker [MC]

**SUBJECT:** Session 1: Priority Intelligence Requirements (PIR)

---

#### **1. SITUATION**

The candidate is inserted into the AO to monitor a derelict compound currently utilized as a transit hub for hostile courier elements. Intelligence suggests a high-level transfer of sensitive material will occur within the 45-minute observation window.

#### **2. MISSION OBJECTIVE**

Establish a concealed Observation Post (OP) and document specific technical and logistical data to support a follow-on strike by the SAS/SBS.

#### **3. PRIORITY INTELLIGENCE REQUIREMENTS (PIR)**

Candidates must identify and record the following five data points in their **Written Intelligence Report**:

- **PIR 1: HVT IDENTIFICATION**
    
    - Identify the courier lead. Record distinguishing features (clothing, gear, visible tattoos/scars) and confirm the exact time of arrival.
        
- **PIR 2: PHYSICAL SECURITY (STATIC)**
    
    - Identify all sentry positions and static security hardware (e.g., CCTV cameras, motion sensors). Record their exact Bearing-Distance-Reference-Target (B-D-R-T) data from the OP.
        
- **PIR 3: GUARD ROTATION PATTERN**
    
    - Observe and record the timing and route of the perimeter patrol. Identify the gap in security coverage (the "dead window") during the rotation.
        
- **PIR 4: LOGISTICAL ASSETS**
    
    - Identify the vehicle used for the transfer. Record the make, model, color, and license plate (or unique markings). Note if the vehicle remains "hot" (engine running) during the transfer.
        
- **PIR 5: C2/COMMS INFRASTRUCTURE**
    
    - Identify the primary communication method used by the hostiles (e.g., handheld radios, satellite phone, or runner). Identify the location of any visible antennas or signal-boosting equipment.

#### **4. REPORTING DIRECTIVE**

- **Format:** All data must be logged chronologically using the **Contact Log** format.
    
- **Accuracy:** Sketches of the compound layout must be included, highlighting the vulnerabilities identified in PIR 2 and 3.
    
- **Signature:** Ensure the report is signed with the candidate's callsign and timestamped upon exfiltration.

### **Instructor Grading Note (OPFOR Instructions):**

To ensure a "Passing" grade, the OPFOR players must perform the following actions during the 45-minute window:

1. One vehicle (e.g., a Land Rover or technical) arrives at the 15-minute mark.
    
2. Two guards conduct a swap at a specific gate at the 25-minute mark.
    
3. The HVT (wearing a distinct tan baseball cap or vest) exits the vehicle to retrieve a hard-case at the 30-minute mark.
    
4. One guard uses a long-range radio (simulated) on the roof for a 30-second window.
