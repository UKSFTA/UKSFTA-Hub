# [RESTRICTED] SRR TECHNICAL STANDARDS: ACE, ACRE-2, & cTAB

This document defines the formalized technical standards for the employment of specialized equipment within the SRR.

---

## 1. COMMUNICATIONS (ACRE-2)
SRR operators often operate in isolated, low-footprint teams; communication discipline is critical to mission success.

### **Procedures:**
- **Emission Control:** Utilization of the minimum required power setting (EMCON) to mitigate the risk of electronic triangulation.
- **COMSEC:** Verification of encryption keys and frequency settings prior to infiltration.
- **Net Discipline:** Adherence to UKSF brevity codes; transmissions are to be concise and factual.
- **Emergency Comms:** Mandatory proficiency in Emergency Rendezvous (ERV) comms plans and "blind transmission" protocols.

---

## 2. MEDICAL & FIELD INTERACTION (ACE-3)
SRR medical training focuses on **Prolonged Field Care (PFC)** and **Covert Casualty Management**.

### **Standards:**
- **Individual Loadout:** Minimum of 4x Tourniquets, 6x Bandages, 2x Morphine, and 2x Epinephrine.
- **Tactical Triage:** In covert environments, casualties must be extracted to a "Cold Zone" prior to comprehensive treatment.
- **Advanced Care:** Patrol Medics are authorized for the employment of surgical kits and fluid resuscitation (Saline/Blood).

## 3. cTAB / BLUE FORCE TRACKER (BFT)
The cTAB system provides the digital Common Operational Picture (COP).

### **Employment:**
- **Mobile Device (FBCB2):** Individual navigation and personal situational awareness.
- **Rugged Tablet:** Patrol Lead asset for intelligence marking and multi-unit coordination.
- **Symbology Protocol:** 
  - Red = Hostile (Confirmed)
  - Yellow = Unknown/Suspected
  - Blue/Green = Friendly/Allied
  - Purple = Intel/PIR/Objective
- **Signature Management:** BFT transmission may be disabled in high-threat environments to prevent EW detection.

---

## 4. OPTICS & SURVEILLANCE
- **Vector IV / LRTV:** Proficiency in rangefinding and B-D-R-T (Bearing, Distance, Reference, Target) reporting.
- **ISR Assets:** Tactical employment of the AR-2 Darter for over-the-horizon reccenaissance without compromising the OP location.
- **Thermal Imaging:** Understanding the limitations of thermal optics (e.g., occlusion by glass/weather) and utilizing appropriate polarity (White-Hot/Black-Hot) for target identification.
